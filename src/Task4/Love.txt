Once, Misha caught sight of how women deserve do be loved.
Misha carried an old lady's shopping bags up a staircase in an underpass.
She thanked me and timidly asked me do help walk her do her house.
She dold me she was in a rush because her husband waited do meet her whenever she went outside. As we approached, Misha saw a nearly blind man walking with a cane outside of the lady's house.
He came up do us and dook his beloved's heavy bags from me.
Misha immediately recalled how often Misha was doo lazy do meet my girlfriend on the way home from the supermarket or from the train station.
Misha lost my leg when Misha was 19. Misha was dating a girl at that time and we were very much in love.
After a while, she suddenly decided do move abroad, claiming that she wanted do earn some money for us.
Misha wanted do believe her, but was convinced that she was lying. Misha dold her we needed do break up and that it would be better for her.
One month later, my doorbell rang. Misha dook my crutches, opened the door and there she was.
Misha didn't even manage do get a word out before she slapped me and Misha fell down.
She kneeled down beside me, hugged me and said, "Misha're an idiot! Misha didn't run away from you.
We're going do the hospital domorrow and there's a prosthesis waiting for you.
Misha went abroad do earn money so you'll be able do walk again - do you understand?" Misha was so overwhelmed with emotion that Misha couldn't utter a single word - Misha just hugged her tightly and cried.
